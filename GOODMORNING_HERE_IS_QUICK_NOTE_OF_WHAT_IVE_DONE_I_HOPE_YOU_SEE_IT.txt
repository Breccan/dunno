Hey, Hope you see this.

So I added tells, says, look, movement, tidied up the interface a little and got it working on the host in both forms.

Look at things hasn't been done, but then there aren't things yet.

One thing that needs to be done soonish is making it so that you see who's in the room etc and when they enter and leave. I got someone else to log in and it felt really weird when I couldn't see them or do stuff.

I think to get a bit of buzz going we'll probably have to play up the amusing writing a bit more than otherwise. Possibly focus on some entertaining disco based combat?

Oh I implemented getKeys in the hash in the mootools file. Seemed like the quickest place.

I added a player hash to rooms as well so that say targets people you're near. Should be easy to add a global chat as well.

See you in 8 hours or so. Around the 22'nd hour of the competition.
